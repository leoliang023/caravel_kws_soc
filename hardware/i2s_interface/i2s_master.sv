    // The internal implementation of the i2s_busmaster would go here.
    // It would typically include a state machine to manage the I2S protocol,
    // shift registers or counters for serial-to-parallel conversion of the data,
    // and control logic for the generation of sck and ws signals based on the 
    // I2S timing requirements.
