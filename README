this is the README file for my kws soc

This repository contains a SoC based on caravel SoC.
The main idea is to implement the kws feature on the user project wrapper with a harden module.

When it is enabled, the harden module will moonitor the audio input stream 
and when a matched keyword is spotted, it triggers an interrupt to the management wrapper, 
the processor will deal with this interrupt.
When the kws module is disable, it is waiting for enable signal to switch into working status.

The software interrupt program will be running on the processor.


The detailed architecture and control methodology is still under consideration.
